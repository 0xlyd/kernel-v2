It is meant to complement the many exciting and engaging projects already happening all over the world. We have designed the course such that it will take as little or as much of your time as you are willing to give.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Each week only contains two `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Crafted Readings`}</strong>{`, which will take you no longer than 10 minutes to read in total. This is the only requirement for participation. Each Thursday, we host a Fireside talk with an industry expert, which generally takes another 1h30 of your time and each track has a weekly call with their own focus, which is also around 1hr or 1h30 long. In total, this comes to around 3h30 per week.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Then, there are three or four `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Curated Materials`}</strong>{`, which are summaries of talks, podcasts, or longer essays from various parts of the intarwebz. Reading these briefs should take around an hour in total (could be more or less depending on how you read and whether English is your first language). This is the next level of possible engagement, which will lead you to ask better questions in Slack and on the weekly track-specific and Fireside calls.`}</p>\n    <p>{`If you watch the embedded videos, listen to the podcasts, and read the full essays, this can take up to 3-6 hours, depending on the module. This is not expected, but it will help you gain a full perspective. It will help you host your own `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`juntos`}</em>{` (conversations for mutual improvement which anyone in Kernel can host at any time on any topic they like) and lead discussions in Slack.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Essentially, we have tried to make sure that those who have full time jobs need not spend more than a few hours a week in order to participate in and benefit from the course, while those with more time can use Kernel as if it were a full time job.
