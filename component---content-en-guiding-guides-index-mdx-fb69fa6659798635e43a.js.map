In fact, when someone says something which you disagree with or don't follow, it is a `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`great gift`}</strong>{`, because it gives you the opportunity to examine in detail your own resistances and bias. When you find yourself nervous, confused, confronted or frustrated, try your best to take a few deep breaths, settle your attention once more in your heart, remember that you are here to learn, and then ask another question. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Asking questions from a place of genuine neutrality is what can bring people to answers they themselves weren't fully aware of before the conversation and - trust us - that is the greatest gift you can give another human being. We're not trying to transmit our own knowledge in these spaces, we're trying to help each person come to their own realisation of that which they already are and already know, because that is what the First People's greeting is really about:`}</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`Tsamkwa /tge? `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`Are your eyes nicely open?`}</em><br parentName=\"p\"></br>{`\n`}{`Kiri kwa /tge. `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`My eyes are nicely open.`}</em></p>\n    </blockquote>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
