This means you'll need to return to do  future reviews. Each full module (including curated content) will take a few hours to read.  In a conventional course, youâ€™d forget most of what you learned over time, perhaps retaining a handful of ideas. However, with spaced repetition built into the medium, a small additional commitment of time means you will remember significantly more. Doing this wonâ€™t be difficult, it will be easier than the initial read. Furthermore, youâ€™ll be able to read other material which builds on these ideas. It will open up an entire world.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Please indulge us by answering the questions you find in the text. For each question, think about what you believe the answer to be, click to reveal the actual answer, and then mark whether you remembered or not. If you can recall, thatâ€™s great. If not, thatâ€™s also fine, just note the correct answer and continue.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This spaced-repetition approach is why the questions only require a few seconds to read and answer. Theyâ€™re not complex exercises, in the style of a textbook. Rather, the questions have a different point: the promise each question makes is that you will remember the answer forever. Itâ€™s to permanently change your thinking.`}</p>\n    <Flash mdxType=\"Flash\">\n      <Card mdxType=\"Card\">\n        <p>{`Q: What is my purpose?`}</p>\n        <p>{`A: To change how you think!
