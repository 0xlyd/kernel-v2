# Design and Specification Tools

There is an entire world of great design tools out there. Here, again, we aim to provide you with a highly curated list of tools - outside of the general go-to ones like Figma and Adobe - that we ourselves _use on a daily basis_ and which have made a profound impact on the way in which we work and the quality of what we are able to produce.

## On Your Marks

Before recommendeing tools, our mentors have provided some great resources to familiarise you with the best practices for design thinking, human-centred designed, quick iteration and user feedback. Please go through these carefully before you start any new project.

## Get Set

Before going anywhere near writing code or actual software, you need to be speaking to users, doing the sorts of research outlined above, testing your hypotheses, iterating on your ideas and exploring the space around your initial thoughts. Stephen Johnson calls this the "adjacent possible". Here are some great tools for sketch out ideas in a way that will allow you to test them without committing too many resources in the wrong directions.

## Go!

Now that you've done proper user testing, whiteboarded your ideas with your team and your users, conducted multiple rounds of research, iteration and feedback and sketched out in increasingly greater detail a product the world actually needs, you can begin to think about full-on design systems to make the work easy, modular, flexible and adaptable to an ever-changing market in which you're trying to find a sustainable fit.
