# ðŸŽ“ Learn how to learn

If ["What is value?"](/learn/module-1/value/) was the ultimate question, then this is the holy 
grail. We'll use the same pattern of thought we've been building up to try and get a foothold... 

First, we must understand what learning is not. It is not the acquisition of knowledge - 
that is properly called wisdom. It is not the ability to memorize content and pass an 
assessment - that is called regurgitation and has the same relationship to real learning 
as that between how birds feed their young and the moment they are ejected from the nest 
and must either fly or die.

Learning how to learn is more like a process. But it is a process with very specific 
characteristics. It requires a sincere desire to know; a determination to develop the 
discipline required to practice what you know every day; a passion that will not let you 
stop until you know; and a heart clear enough to know its own [intention](/learn/module-3/intention/) 
for pursuing knowledge at all.

Unless you're burning to find the answer, and unless you're willing to give up everything 
in the pursuit of that answer, you will never truly learn it. Learning how to learn is not 
something you can learn about. You just have to let it happen by being constantly aware. When 
that which illumines the [unutterable question you are](/learn/module-0/play-of-pattern/#the-honest-question) shines through, you must follow its trail without hesitation.

The <Link to="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HYlbg6RKMA&t=73s">secret fire</Link> 
at the core of your being might have nothing to do with building a better web: you must still 
be honest enough to follow it. Ultimately, learning how to learn is a discipline built on a 
deep [trust](/learn/module-0/trust/) in what we could call the underlying pattern. You have to 
trust that you will come to know what you need to know when you need to know it. This creates 
the necessary neurological conditions for **useful knowledge** to take [root](/learn/module-1/meaning/#further-references).

Q: Truly learning how to learn is not just an intellectual process. We have to let it happen by cultivating what?

The rest is practice. Practice, practice, practice - until you realise that there is no 
difference between practice and perfection. That what you most wanted to know was here all 
along, right with you - closer than your jugular vein - and all that work and struggle and 
acquisition and desire and practice and letting go was just to bring you back into this moment, 
right now. 

There is nothing else to learn about. Nothing more to know.
