# Free Learning Forever

Kernel is, first and foremost, a community of human beings trying to learn together about the best ways to build a genuinely better web. In order to do that, we present here a brand new kind of learning medium. 

Based on the feedback from over 600 people who have already completed this course, we have taken the eight weeks of structured content we first created and turned it into the world's first token-powered spaced repetition learning environment. What on earth do those words even mean? Well, do the course to find out... 

In short, we took Andy Matuschak's and Michael Nielsen's work on the [mnemonic medium](/learn/module-4/remember), and figured out a way to ensure it stays effectively free forever, while still generating income. Which sounds impossible, until you realise what [programmable money](/learning/module-2/engineering) _really means_, which Kernel will teach you (now both in content **and** use). 

To use the flashcards, you will need to sign up and lock 100 DAI. We take that DAI and put it into a yield-bearing protocol for you. Completing all the cards should take no less than 3 months from when you sign up. At the end of that period, whether you have completed them successfuly or not, you can claim your DAI back. 

If you chose to mint $LEARN tokens with your fee, which guarantee you access to Kernel forever and can be traded on the open market, we'll add the yield to your amount minted. If you just claim the DAI back because you don't want to be a part of the community, we'll give you your full fee back, but keep any yield you earned for maintenance and improvement of our courses.
