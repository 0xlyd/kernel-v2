# ðŸŒ± Welcome To Kernel

Kernel is a peer-to-peer learning community dedicated to the journey towards a better understanding of truth: in our work, in our relationships with others, and in our inner worlds. 

> ðŸ’¡ Find the others, have fun, learn freely, and get funding. 

A kernel is the essence of a seed. In computers, a kernel is the core of the operating system. There are many metaphorical rabbit holes round here, but basically, we're just a bunch of friends building cool web3 stuff together.

Our syllabus aims to build *long-term thinking skills*, provide *context and technical history*, and introduce you to the *patterns* and *modes* required to flourish in decentralized, open communities like Web 3.

This website hosts the Core Syllabus. It is free and open source and always will be. You can go through it whenever you like, with whomever you like, at whatever pace you like: you do not need any further permission. However, we learn best together, especially in a course like this which is fundamentally about asking better questions, rather than parroting back superficial answers.

The Kernel Fellowship is an 8 week program we run ~3 times a year, which introduces 200+ new Fellows to the Kernel, a peer-to-peer community focused on building lifelong relationships and long-term projects utilizing Web 3. 

The glue which binds all the tracks together is the **people** in each cohort. By connecting you with the best minds we know to teach you practical thinking skills, combined with effective patterns for using innovative tools and creating decentralized solutions, we aim to help you become one of the **people** building a new way of living, day by digital day.

## What is Kernel, though?

It's much easier to describe what Kernel is about: humility, honesty, gratitude, and intentional service.

<Process>

We are humble because, through our curiosity, our creativity, our suffering, our joy we have come to know and embody how little any one person can know in isolation.

We are honest because it is the most courageous way to live, the straightest path from head to heart, and the means of connecting them permanently.

We are grateful because there is no other choice. Any examined life can only ever lead, in the final analysis, to gratitude beyond reason or measure.

Our intention is to serve, because it brings us back - again and again - to humility, sealing the circle and protecting the kernel so it can sprout in the right season.

</Process>

Whom do we serve, though? First and foremost, we are here to serve each other, because we are each others environment. Genuine service also takes us towards the goal of any way to meaningful self knowledge, which is the realisation that there, in truth, no otherness. 

We also have a common, external purpose: **to serve the continued creation of free money**. In this context, Kernel is a gift. It literally began that way: Vivek set out to give back to a community which had given him a livelihood the kind of experience he had found so meaningful in his formative years. Andy set out to give Vivek the kind of educational model which would allow him to do so. And each block is carefully and intentionally crafted with all sorts of gifted people, each unique, though we all carry the desire to share our gifts with the world around us. It is the still-beating heart of an old way of being which we are slowly bringing into the digital world.

We learn from each other, and we give of ourselves until self and other lose the sense of separation which so often rules our interactions. And in this is a truth which cannot be given or received, it can only be grown in your own heart as you come to trust in the inalienable value of who you already are.
