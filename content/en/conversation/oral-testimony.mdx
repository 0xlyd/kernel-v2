# Oral Testimony

<StatusBanner warning sticky>

**You were born into beauty, as beauty, for harmoniously balanced life. That is the truth.**

## The Greater Conversation of All Time

> My gift to the world is describing the way back home; describing the journey back into a way 
of being human here that understands that I am part of a whole tapestry of life that is ever 
running.

> This place of understanding is not a perfect place: there are potholes there. Perhaps it was 
never perfect. That's why my clan grandfather used to say, "Here we are, holy Earth surface 
walkers, dazzled by creation and coming upon temptation." We are being called to come to terms 
with the truth of ourselves, the purity of ourselves, the honour of this body, the innocence of 
our love and eventually to become the one who sends out that song of understanding.

> So I say, "OK". I will live into this heart that You gave to me. It is a medicine unlike any 
other.

understanding of our shared, human history.

## Relevant History, Anthropology, Archaeology & Architecture

Akala's address at the Oxford Union and David Gareber and David Wengrow's discussion at the 
University of Amsterdam both provide important intellectual background for those less able to 
follow what is being transmitted in the oral testimony above.
